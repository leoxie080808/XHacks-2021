# XHacks-2021 EyeScreen
Leo and Eva submission project for the 2021 X-Hacks, presenting EyeScreen! 

EyeScreens main objective is to aid users with improving their workflows regardless of their tasks. The key way of interacting with laptops and computers is through our finger tips, making it important not to disrupt the flow from our hands. Having to stop typing or letting go of a mouse is always frustrating, especially when certain devices or keyboards are missing features like prtsc. This is why EyeScreen uses the user's eyes, and since blinking is part of a natural reflex, EyeScreen can only be purposefully activated through fast double and triple blinks. This avoids major accidental activations, which is vital in maintaining a users workflow. Instead of dividing your attention and focus, EyeScreen runs silently in the background, out of sight.
